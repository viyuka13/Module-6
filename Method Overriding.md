# üêü Method Overriding-Fish and Shark Class Inheritance in Python

## üß† AIM:
To write a Python program that demonstrates class inheritance by creating a parent class `Fish` with a method `type`, and a child class `Shark` that overrides the `type` method.

## üìã ALGORITHM:

1. Define the `Fish` class with a method named `type()` that prints `"fish"`.
2. Define the `Shark` class as a subclass of `Fish`, and override the `type()` method to print `"shark"`.
3. Create an instance of the `Fish` class named `obj_goldfish`.
4. Create an instance of the `Shark` class named `obj_hammerhead`.
5. Use a `for` loop to iterate over both objects.
6. Within the loop, call the `type()` method using the loop variable.
7. Output will demonstrate method overriding: printing `"fish"` and `"shark"` accordingly.

## üíª PROGRAM:
    class Fish:
        def type(self):
            print("fish")
    
    class Shark(Fish):
        def type(self):
            print("shark")
    
    obj_goldfish = Fish()
    obj_hammerhead = Shark()
    
    for obj in (obj_goldfish, obj_hammerhead):
        obj.type()

## RESULT
The Python program demonstrating method overriding in class inheritance has been executed successfully, and the output has been verified.
